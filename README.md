This project is a basic client-server application written in Java that demonstrates how to transfer image files over a TCP socket connection. The client reads an image from the local file system, streams it as raw bytes, and sends it to the server. The server listens for incoming connections, receives the image data, and saves it to disk. This project showcases foundational network programming concepts using Java's socket and I/O libraries, and is ideal for understanding how file transfer works in a networked environment.
